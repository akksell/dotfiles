# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles I use across my unix-based systems. Some configs may not apply to all systems (e.g. hyprland configs will not apply to MacOS).

For now, they are manually symlinked to the correct location in the $HOME directory per user. An install script in the future should take care of installation/symlinking to improve this but as of now this is an incremental process.
